My personal site, originally an HTML sheet converted to a small React.js application. 

Meant to be a "land-and-direct" site but was helpful in practicing and implementing the React.js Framework.

### **TODO plans:**

-Implement "blog" part of site 
-Brainstorm 4th section
-Implement routing as site grows to keep as a 'single-page' application

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
